# Using Node-Red to simulate sensors

In this quick lab, you will learn howto setup and run Node-Red within the IBM Cloud and use it to experiment with virtual sensors.

# 1. Create and IBMid on the IBM Cloud

In order to work in the IBM Cloud you need to register and get an IBMid. 
If you already have an IBMid, just log in to the IBM Cloud. Else, follow the next steps to create a free Lite account.

1. Goto [IBM CLoud](https://ibm.biz/becode_liege)
2. Click Create an IBM Cloud account
3. Follow the steps to create your IBMid

You can now start using the IBM Cloud. Lots of the available services have a free tier, so you can start experimenting for free.

# 2. Deploy a Node-Red starter kit

Following set of steps details out on the deployment of the Node-Red starter kit

1. Log into the IBM Cloud with your IBM id and access the ***'Catalog'***
2. Choose to click on the **'Node-RED Starter'**. This can be easy found by clicking on **'Starter Kits'** from the left menu.
